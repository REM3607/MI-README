# Declare and instantiate classes in TypeScript

Classes enable you to express common object-oriented patterns in a standard way, making features like inheritance more readable and interoperable. In TypeScript, classes are yet another way to define the shape of an object, in addition to describing object types with interfaces and functions.

If you haven't worked with classes, it may be helpful to review a few basic concepts.

You can think of a class as a blueprint for building objects, like a car.
A Car class describes the attributes of a car, for example, the make, color, or number of doors. 
It also describes behaviors that the car can perform, like accelerating, braking, or turning.

But the Car class is just a plan for building the car. 
You must build an instance of Car from the Car class before it becomes an object that you can assign property values to (like setting the color to blue) or call its behaviors (like applying the brakes.)

The Car class can be reused to create any number of new Car objects, each with their own characteristics. You can also extend the Car class.
For example, an ElectricCar class might extend Car. 
It will have all the same attributes and behaviors of Car but can also have its own unique attributes and behaviors, like its range and a charging operation.
